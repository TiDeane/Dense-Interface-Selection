# Dense Interface Selection

IST Human-Computer Interaction second course project. The goal of this project was to minimize target selection time in a dense interface (80 targets).

During the Bake-Off, each student tested some projects from other groups, trying to get their best time on them, and the average time for each project was measured. This project's final average time (including time penaulties for missing) was 2.526 seconds (awarding a final grade of 85%).
